This was a project made for University for the "Web Technologies" course, which consists of a Flutter application alongside a NodeJs REST Api. It's purpose is to allow users to give ratings for other users based on social interactions that they had in real life, which will affect their overall user score. The idea was inspired by the episode called "Nosedive" from Black Mirror.

To run this application, you will need the Flutter framework in order to compile it. Get it from [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
To do that use `flutter run` or  `flutter run -d chrome` (additional set-up required for the web application). Check the manual [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web).
